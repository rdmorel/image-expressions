# image-expressions
image manipulation in python


In this lab we will extend the image arithmetic class we developed in this weekâ€™s lecture. You will overload the python operators that are used for bitwise logic (e.g. and, or, not, xor).

1. Create pydoc strings documenting all the methods.

2. Finish the class by implementing the invert, or, xor, and gt operators.

3. Experiment with image operators. How do they differ on color, grayscale, and binary images? Come up with some uses for the different operators.
